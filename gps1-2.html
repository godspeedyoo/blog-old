        <h3>What is Pair Programming?</h3>
        <p>Pair programming is a way of developing software which involves two or more programmers sitting side 
          by side in order to create more efficient and cleaner code. By having two people work together, pair programming ensures
          quality by having one programmer drive (type the code), and one programmer navigate (dictate the flow). Both programmers collaborate
          on the tactics and strategy behind the code. It is a best practice for these programmers to switch between these roles.

        <h3>Why is Pair Programming Important to DBC?</h3>
        <p>Pair programming is important to DBC for several reasons.
          1. It produces better code
          2. It is how many real world programming works
          3. It encourages multiple viewpoints and alternative problem solving

        <h3>Driver Vs Navigator</h3>
        <h4>Driver</h4>
          <p>The driver is the one who writes the code. Drivers focus on writing each specific line of code, while 
          making syntactical decisions. They make the tactical decisions on solving the task at hand.</p>
          <h4>Navigator</h4>
          <p>The navigator reviews each line as it is typed in. While reviewing, they consider more of a strategic direction
          and think of improvements as well as the bigger picture.</p>

        <h3>My First Pairing Experience</h3>
        <p>My first pairing experience was like dipping my toes in water for the first time. It was a little slow at first while we were getting a feel for how our partner likes to work. There was constant communication and clear role designation in the beginning which helped drive us to get rolling on our task. I realized later down the road that I should have looked over some of the material we agreed to work on so that I wouldn't be so lost. Despite this, my partner was kind enough to patiently explain some of the material as I drove like a teen behind the wheel of a car for the first time. The clear role designation definitely helped us to know what we should be doing, and as we grew comfortable adjusting to our roles, it was smooth sailing by the end.</p>
