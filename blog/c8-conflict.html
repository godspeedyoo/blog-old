                    <h3>The Upset Accountant</h3>
                    <p>It was just another afternoon at the office, and I had been working on some design changes to make to our database system. I was approached by a coworker asking if I had made any changes to our revenue recognition system within the last two days. After asking what was wrong and how it could have happened, I replied several times denying that I had done anything in that part of the system. She went on and ignored this, claiming that I had done something because it was not behaving as expected. While I tried to pry into how her dollars were not being counted correctly, she continued to ignore this line of thought and insisted that I had done something wrong. At this point I notice her becoming visibly upset as she became louder, asking what I had done. Several people are now noticing this conversation and I continue to ask her questions to try to understand and break down the problem. It becomes a cycle of asking about her process and what she expects and being answered with more accusatory remarks instead of anything constructive. The exchange ends with more frustration as she walks away and heads into the CFO's office. Another coworker asks, "man, what did you do?!"</p>

                    <p>Sometime later, after having a conversation with the CFO, there was nothing for me to do and no problem to fix. There was some acknowledgement that I may have had a "conversation" that involved bearing the brunt of someone's frustration, however.</p>

                    <p>During the moments where things were getting heated in the exchange, I noticed that it was going to be easy for me to pick up on that frustration and raise my voice as well. Luckily, I caught myself as a few simple questions might have turned into what might have become an argument, and continued to try and remain relaxed and calm. I said to myself that responding in an equally upset manner willy only exacerbate things, even if it looks like I had screwed up something really badly in front of other coworkers.</p>

                    <p>In the end, I don't think my actions led to making her feel better, but at the very least I didn't let someone else's problems seep into my own and possibly ruin my afternoon. I gave the problem some thought and an honest effort at figuring out how to help, but I couldn't help her in the end. I'm not sure exactly what I'd do differently in this case. I think I could have expressed that what she was saying was not making any sense to me as she used a lot of her accounting jargon in casual conversation, and perhaps asking her to slow down would have benefited me. I was, admittedly, afraid to do such a thing as explaining to someone "you're not making any sense" over and over might not be the most productive thing. Trying to communicate what I was intepreting back was only met with more resistance, so I was kind of stuck. I think the next time I'm faced with a similar situation, I'll try to be more honest about it and if something is not clear, I'll make it known.</p>
