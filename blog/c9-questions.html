					<h3>What is a good question?</h3>
					<p>A lot of what makes up a good question depends on what it is you desire. A question intended to teach someone or to be thought provoking vs. something you need answered asap will have some different criteria. Sometimes, you're looking for a specific answer in a specific way, and other times, it doesn't matter, you just want to hear something. With all this variation, what qualifies as good?</p>
					<h4>You Know What You Are Looking For</h4>
					<p>A good question can only be "good" if it fulfills the reason it was asked in the first place. Imagine you are curious about who makes the best sushi in town, and want to create a site to analyze the data and food critic reviews for sushi aficionados. You want the site to specifically rate sushi based on its quality of ingredients, originality, temperature, taste, and texture. If you were to ask your buddies, "What do you think of this sushi at 45th st?", chances are you're not going to get all the information you need. Instead, a better way to ask would be, "Based on your expertise, how would you rate sushi in terms of this list of qualities?". Figure out what it is you are looking for and formulate the question in regards to that.
					<h4>Good Questions are Specific</h4>
					<p>After realizing what you want to know, you must make sure the intended recipient can understand the question. To do this, you must have communicated clearly what it is you want to know and as much relevant information as possible. "Relevant information" here is important, because this is what can determine the quality of the question asked. Let's look at two questions here:</p>
					<h4>Question 1</h4>
					<p>"How do I see what's in my folder?"</p>
					<h4>Question 2</h4>
					<p>"How can I display the contents of my working directory on a Windows cmd terminal?"</p>
					<p>Question 1 contains no relevant context. We have no idea what folder and what we mean by "see". Question 2 is specific and provides relevant context. Oftentimes, the simplest way to determine what might be relevant is by stepping into someone else's shoes and thinking of how they would interpret the question.</p>
					<h4>Consider your Audience</h4>
					<p>Imagine you are writing a paper for a university professor, and need to know the implications of the Federal Reserve Bank's monetary policy on our inflation rate. Going to reddit and asking a question there probably isn't in your best interest. Querying a database or asking a librarian of any relevant scholarly articles is probably a better bet. Before rushing to the most convenient channel to ask questions, take a moment to think of the most effective place or people to ask them.
					<h4>Take Your Time</h4>
					<p>This doesn't always apply to every situation, but where it allows, take your time to think and formulate a good question. Go over all the previous tips and use your best judgment to get what you need in the most effective way. In a conversation, this can help the person answering to think for themselves, as the back-and-forth nature of conversation can sometimes cause people to lose trains of thought, or even derail into something else entirely. Allow your mind to reflect in conversations and don't be afraid to take your time when allowed.</p>
