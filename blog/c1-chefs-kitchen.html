                    <p>I can't imagine what DBC would be like without this unique culture. I feel like so much of my educational value is coming from the effects of its unique way of thinking and teaching. It is like stepping into a completely different environment, where testing, experimenting, and failing is encouraged rather than a static absorption of material delivered from an instructor or book. I can already feel the shifting in attitude from a top-down approach in education that is all too prevalent to one that encourages giving back to this community. This is a culture designed for rapid growth, development, and change not only for the program as a whole, but for the individual. I have high hopes for this new shift in educational paradigm. As I continue my journey through DBC, it is constantly exceeding my expectations.</p> 

                    <p>I think the challenge here is about being able to adapt. We need to get out of this mindset of being simply consumers in this environment. We need to change the way we approach learning to be able to fully utilize this environment provided for us. The key here is that being a part of this community asks for much more involvement and giving back from the individual. I like being given this opportunity, because staying outside and being at the table is boring. I want to roll up my sleeves, get my hands dirty, and be an integral part of this experience, because that is what DBC is all about.</p>

                    <p>Out of all of this, I'm hoping to not only become a world class developer, but to achieve something even deeper and long-lasting for my personal growth. I hope to learn from these new ideas, from DBC's experience and my cohort as well as within myself, to become a world class learner. Suriving the bootcamp to me is just the first step in a lifelong journey towards constant learning and improving. I hope this doesn't stop with web development - I want to come out of this as a better person.</p>
