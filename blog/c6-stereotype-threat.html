                <p>Stereo type threat is a problem we face when we feel that something about our own identity such as age, sex, race, religion, or ideology is somehow a relevant factor in somehow dealing with a situation. This phenomenon appears to affect people's performances and feelings simply due to the fact that they are made to be aware that some part of their identity plays a factor or role. Thinking back on my experiences with my family, I can remember several occasions where my perception of my identity affected how I felt in that context. Being aware of this will help me to feel and create more neutral situations so that stereo type does not become an issue.</p>

                <p>Some of my own experiences in the past revolved around expectations for performance in school. There were many times where I was made to be aware that being Asian meant that I was expected to do well in Math. I was always quite mediocre, but a dramatic change in my performance happened when I started to believe in these expectations. It is very likely that there were other factors involved, but on a subconscious level, there was an interaction between my perception of expectations, and my own identity. It could have caused me, back then, to focus just a little harder, or pay a little more attention.</p>

                <p>I think it is very important when dealing with other people to try and understand what they might interpreting in their context. By being aware of the possible implications of identity threat, I can find ways to decouple expectations based on identity to its context. Feedback will seen as more honest and sincere when our minds are not thinking how criticism relates to our identities. I can also contribute to a more friendly workplace environment by implicitly communicating with others that stereotypes do not apply to individuals, and that their own identity is not anchored to these generic traits.</p>

                <p>I believe that simply being aware of this issue can help to mitigate some of its effects, and that we should try and catch ourselves when we settle into this thinking pattern. My takeaway from this is that the mind is extremely powerful in these situations, whether it is taking a test, or feeling uncomfortable, and that simply believing something about ourselves can change the outcome in our lives dramatically.</p>
