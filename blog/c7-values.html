            <h2>My Values</h2>
            <p>When I think of the times I've been the happiest, proudest, or most satisfied, these are the values that come to mind:</p>
            
            <p> 
                <li>Accomplishment</li>
                <li>Ambition</li>
                <li>Creativity</li>
                <li>Helping others</li>
                <li>Integrity</li>
                <li>Personal Development</li>
                <li>Quality</li>
            </p>

            <h2>Creativity</h2>
            <p>Creativity is very near and dear to my heart, as it is something that has brought me much joy and freedom throughout my life. A majority of my past and current hobbies involve creativity. From drawing and painting to music, and now programming, I've always had <i>some</i> outlet for creativity. This is my way of expressing my own ideas or to capture and reimagine those of others.</p>

            <h2>Values in my Life</h2>
            <p>On a scale of 1-5, My rating for each of these values in terms of how I try to live up to them:</p>
            <p>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Accomplishment</td>
                        <td>3</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Ambition</td>
                        <td>4</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Creativity</td>
                        <td>5</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Helping Others</td>
                        <td>3</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Integrity</td>
                        <td>4</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Personal Development</td>
                        <td>5</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Quality</td>
                        <td>5</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
            <h2>Advice</h2>
            <p>The last thing someone asked for my advice on was how to set up a many-to-many relationship in a database for my office. I went through the logic, outlined a plan, and left my last mark on the whiteboard before leaving on my last day at this job. It made me happy that my contribution will somehow help make things better and faster for other people in the future. I felt like it was an encapsulation of some of the things I have learned during my time with the company, and it was a way for me to contribute my creative energy in a meaningful and lasting way.</p>
            <h2>Values and Stereotype Threat</h2>
            <p>When I think about my values, I usually think of how I can improve my life by living up to them. It is also a way for me to reflect on if I have been living up to them. Sometimes, I notice that throughout my life that these values shift slightly in priority. For example, there were periods when I felt like I had almost no ambition at all, or at least I wasn't working towards fulfilling them. I'm not really sure how I'm going to mediate stereotype threat by thinking about my values, but I do know that I can't let it get in the way of my own personal fulfillment. Instead, I think that being more aware of myself and of my surroundings will help me to mediate stereotype threat. Practicing mindfullness meditation is helping me to better process my own thoughts and feelings which helps me to deal with things in all areas of my life.</p>
