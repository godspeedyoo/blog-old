                <h2>Ruby: Arrays & Hashes</h2>
                <h2>10-24-14 by Joseph Won</h2>
                <h3><p>Imagine yourself a baseball card collector. You've accumulated a sizable collection and now wish to employ some sort of organizational system. You seek a reliable method to store, organize, and retrieve them when you need. Two of your friends, Jim and Steve, have always boasted that they can organize your collection for you, and that their system is the best. 
                </p>
                <p>Jim is a little special. As long as you've known him, he's been able to memorize numbers. Lots of them. One day, he shows you his binder of cards that he's kept and says to you, "I've put every single card in my collection in order, and if you tell me to find nth card, I can flip to it and find it in no time! Okay, let's put it to the test. Skeptically, you ask for the 257th card in his collection. Without looking, he flips open the sleeves and pulls out a Barry Bonds. Wow, okay this is great! Now, "find me a Sammy Sosa!". Jim is stumped, and has no words. "What's the matter, Jim?" You ask. Jim, abashed, looks down and admits, "I can't, because I'm an <strong>array...</strong></p>
                <img src="http://i.imgur.com/5g28sHA.png" width="200"/>

                <p>Steve, without a moment to respond, busts through the door with his binder and shouts, "Hell, it's about time for <strong>hashes!</strong> You quickly turn around and fire four more player names in quick succession. He takes a little more time, but the cards are produced.</p>

                <p>What we've discovered here is a nuance between Arrays and Hashes in Ruby. Don't worry, they sound more complicated than they are. Arrays care about order. Sure, you can change, sort, and do much more, but at the end of the day, Array only knows how to communicate via some nth item. In Ruby, they look like this:</p>

</pre></div>

</p>
                <p>Arrays and Hashes can both store different types of data. Here we have two Arrays, one with names, and the other with numbers. If I want to ask Jim's array to tell me "what is the 3rd item in your collection?", it would look like this:</p>
                    <p><!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><div style="background: #272822; overflow:auto;width:auto;border:solid gray;border-width:.1em .1em .1em .8em;padding:.2em .6em;"><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #f92672">&gt;&gt;</span><span style="color: #f8f8f2"> jim_array</span><span style="color: #f92672">[</span><span style="color: #ae81ff">2</span><span style="color: #f92672">]</span>

<span style="color: #f92672">=&gt;</span> <span style="color: #e6db74">&quot;babe ruth&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</p>

                    <p> Why doesn't it point to <span style="background-color: #fff0f0">&#39;sammy sosa&#39;</span>? After all, he is the second in the list. Like I said, Jim is a little special, he starts all his counting with 0.<p>

                    <p> Let's say you want to find out the player number. There is no connection to any meaningful player name in the number_array, so we can't use that and player number isn't stored in Jim's array at all. How do we connect the two? The <strong>key</strong> here is to use a hash.</p>

                    <p> Steve's hash looks different because now we can <em>assign</em> a player's name with their number. We use '=>' to do just that. To ask for Babe Ruth's number, we say:</p>

                    <p><!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><div style="background: #272822; overflow:auto;width:auto;border:solid gray;border-width:.1em .1em .1em .8em;padding:.2em .6em;"><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #f92672">&gt;&gt;</span> <span style="color: #f8f8f2">steve_hash</span><span style="color: #f92672">[</span><span style="color: #e6db74">&#39;babe ruth&#39;</span><span style="color: #f92672">]</span>

<span style="color: #f92672">=&gt;</span> <span style="color: #ae81ff">3</span>
</pre></div>
</p>



                <p>And there you have it, Arrays that can store your data in order and quickly retrieve them, and Hashes that can store sets of <strong>keys</strong> and <strong>values</strong>. In our example above, 'babe ruth' is a key that points to a certain value, 3. "Why not always use hashes since they're more flexible?", you might ask. True, they are flexible, but sometimes an array will do the trick, and faster. When we get into huge collections of data, speed can be an important factor in this decision. Also, you can even have an Arrays inside of a Hashs, or a Hashes with Arrays. Things can get crazy!</p></h3>
